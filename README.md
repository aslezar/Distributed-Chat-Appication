# Distributed Chat Application | VibeTalk

The backend is distributed and horiziontally scalable.

This is Distributed Chat application, Users can talk in real time. i implemented this because i am curious i how distributed systems work, how they coordinate, what problems they faced and the besy way to do it, is by doing it so i started this project. My first intial target is hanlind 10K online users. I have documented my learning jouney and problems i faced in this readme itself.

The backend is distributed & horizontally scalable. Technology used in backend Socket.io, redis(cache & pub/sub to maintain consistency among different servers), haproxy (for loadbalancer), mongodb(for persistence).

## Features

- Designed for 10K online users
- Uses rabbitmq to send message.
- Utilizes bucketing strategy to store, retrieve, and send messages faster and more efficiently

## Before Starting This I Did Not Know

- How RabbitMQ works
- AMQP Protocol
- How different distributed systems coordinate.
- Different Schema design patterns like bucket, tree, approximation, and attribute
- MongoDB ObjectId contains a timestamp, making them roughly sortable based on creation time, which is suitable for this case.

                    !! Now I know all of these! ðŸ˜„

## Problems I Faced

Majorly these 2 are the main problems i faced.

1. How to handle so many messages ??

    - I choosed RabbitMQ queue for storing messages before they are handled by the server. Kafka is a overkill for this and redis don't have durability. RabbiMQ comes out to be the best option here.

2. How to know which server is user connected to?
    - Solved it by using a RabbitMQ queue and exchange. For user 1 on server 2, I bind the server queue to the exchange based on userId. I didn't want to add more stack like Redis to create a "Server to User" table, as this would add more complexity. So I came up with this solution. After discussing the potential performance impact of having so many bindings with the RabbitMQ team, i finalized this architecture.

Here is the flow of a message from sender to reciever.

3. **Time synchronization for bucketing**:
    - **Problem**: For bucketing to work properly, servers need to sync time.

## Journey - Timeline

**Dec 29 - Jan 4**

- Started researching different technologies used in distributed systems, and learned about:
    - Kafka
    - Redis
    - RabbitMQ
    - Nginx

**Jan 4 - Jan 5**

- Set up Docker environment for fast setup
- Read Discord blogs to understand how they work
- Read about WhatsApp's use of ejabberd
- Tried RabbitMQ with a queue for each user [**Failed 1**][Having so many queues caused significant delays during RabbitMQ node restarts.]

**Jan 6**

- Found possible approaches to solve the first two problems
- Prepared architecture diagram
- Studied Discord message schema
- Explored compound keys
- Learned about MongoDB IDs being sortable and their composition

**Jan 7**

Tried RabbitMQ for message and user updates [**Failed 2**][Not ideal if a node goes down, it becomes unaware of who is online]

**Jan 8**

Used RabbitMQ for message delivery and Redis for "Server to User" map [**Failed 3**][Complexity is too high to handle each user's presence. Redis will become a single point of failure and it will require three different stacks (Server, RabbitMQ, Redis) to scale up together]

**Jan 9**

Created a queue for each server and bound it to exchange based on userID
  [**Green Go** - Only problem is having so many bindings, solved this by creating multiple exchanges and partitioning users to them by a simple hash function.]

**Jan 11**  
Configured Nginx and WebSockets connection to Nginx, provided server unique ID to make them identifiable.

**Jan 12**  
Learned about Prometheus-Grafana-Loki for metrics collection, logging, and visualization.

## Quickstart

To keep the setup simple, I will provide only one way of doing it. Clone the repo and spin up the Docker container:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

Start the Frontend:

```bash
cd client && npm i && npm run dev
```
